# Connect-4-Face-Down-Game
A version of the classic Connect 4 game where the board is "face down", meaning the pieces don't drop down.

Note: This game relies on sound & image files that must be in the same folder as the .java code file of the game.
      It will not work if these files aren't in the same folder as the actual code file.
      
If anyone knows how I can compress everything into a .jar file, or if someone could even do it for me, I would 
appreciate it very much!
      
Enjoy!
