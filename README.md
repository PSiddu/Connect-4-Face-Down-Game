# Connect-4-Face-Down-Game
A version of the classic Connect 4 game where the board is "face down", meaning the pieces don't drop down.

I created this game for my final project in my 10th Grade Computer Science Class. I originally was using Java Applets,
but because of how outdated that is, I switched to Java Swing. Since the program was being marked, I have very descriptive
comments, so the code is very easy to follow. I ended up doing well on the project, getting full marks.

Note: This game relies on sound & image files that must be in the same folder as the .java code file of the game.
      It will not work if these files aren't in the same folder as the actual code file.
      
If anyone knows how I can compress everything into a .jar file, or if someone could even do it for me, I would 
appreciate it very much! That way, I could share the program with people without presenting the source code and individual
files to them!
      
Enjoy!
